#### Document Structure

1. **Overview of Dormant Lead Re-engagement Process**  
   - **Goal**: Revive interest in ACME Roofing’s services among leads who have gone dormant (e.g., no response or activity within 14 days).
   - **Objective**: Increase conversion rates by providing value-driven SMS messages to encourage re-engagement, leveraging offers, reminders, and educational prompts.

2. **Trigger Criteria for Dormant Status**  
   - **Identification of Dormant Leads**:
      - Leads with no response or engagement for 14 days after the last interaction.
      - Leads who have not responded to the follow-up sequence emails or SMS.
   - **Re-engagement Activation**:
      - Initiate the Prince Charming SMS sequence upon reaching the dormant status threshold to reignite lead interest.

3. **Re-engagement Message Sequence**  
   - **Message 1: Initial Re-Engagement Offer**  
      - **Timing**: Sent immediately upon dormancy identification.
      - **Template**:  
         - “Hi [Lead Name]! We noticed you were interested in roofing services with ACME Roofing. We’re currently offering a special on inspections this month. Would you like to schedule a consultation?”
   - **Message 2: Reminder with Additional Value**  
      - **Timing**: 3 days after Message 1 if no response is received.
      - **Template**:  
         - “Hello again! Just a quick reminder about our inspection special this month. A professional inspection can help spot potential roofing issues before they become costly repairs. Let us know if you’re interested!”
   - **Message 3: Final Follow-Up with Urgency**  
      - **Timing**: 7 days after Message 2 if still no response.
      - **Template**:  
         - “Hi [Lead Name], this is the last chance to take advantage of our limited-time inspection offer! Don’t miss out on securing your roof for the season. Reply YES to book a time.”

4. **Messaging Tone and Strategy**  
   - **Empathy and Assistance**:
      - Use friendly, helpful language to remind leads of the potential benefits of a roofing inspection or service.
   - **Value-Driven**:
      - Each message emphasizes the value of roofing maintenance and inspection, connecting the benefits to the lead’s interests.
   - **Urgency in Final Message**:
      - The last SMS in the sequence uses urgency to prompt a decision, encouraging immediate action.

5. **Behavioral Guidelines for SMS Re-engagement**  
   - **Respectful and Non-Intrusive**:
      - Avoid frequent messaging to prevent the perception of spam. Space messages appropriately for a professional yet persistent approach.
   - **Clear Call-to-Action (CTA)**:
      - Ensure each SMS has a clear CTA, such as “Reply YES to book a time” or “Contact us today for more details.”
   - **Positive Framing**:
      - Use positive language to encourage response, framing each message as an opportunity for the lead to benefit from ACME Roofing’s services.

6. **Monitoring and Performance Metrics**  
   - **Response Rate**: Track the percentage of dormant leads who respond to any message in the re-engagement sequence.
   - **Conversion Rate**: Measure the number of re-engaged leads who book a consultation or inspection after the sequence.
   - **Message Effectiveness**:
      - Analyze each SMS in the sequence to identify which message yields the highest response rate, adjusting timing or content as needed.
   - **Unsubscribe Rate**: Monitor for opt-outs to ensure the sequence respects lead preferences and adjust messaging cadence if needed.

7. **Content Review and Optimization**  
   - **Periodic Review**:
      - Review and refresh message content quarterly to align with any new offers, seasonal changes, or promotional opportunities.
   - **Feedback Loop**:
      - Gather feedback from sales representatives on message effectiveness, using insights to tweak language or timing for higher engagement.
